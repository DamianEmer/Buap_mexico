            <h2>Theoretical foundation: Toggle Switch</h2>
            <div class="container-paragraph">
                The Toggle switch is one of the synthetic gene-regulatory network designed by Gardner, Cantor and
                collins at the beginning of 2000. This network was constructed using two repressors and two constitutive
                promoters and each promoter is inhibited by the repressor that is transcribed by the opposing promoter.
                Toggle switch shows bistability over a wide range of parameter values, this bistability arises from the
                mutually inhibitory arrangement of the genes repressors. In absence of inducers, two states are
                possible:
            </div>

            <div class="container-paragraph">
                <ul>
                    <li>First one: The promoter 1 transcribes repressor 2</li>
                    <li>Second one: The promoter 2 transcribes repressor 1</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="container-paragraph">
                Switching is activated introducing an inducer in the environment which inactivate one of the currently
                active repressor. The inducer allows the opposing repressor to be maximally transcribed until it stably
                represses the originally active promoter.
            </div>

            <!-- <img src="" alt=""> -->

            <div class="container-paragraph">
                Theoretically toggle design does not require any specialized promoters, whit this in mind we decided to
                use the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (pdh) promoter containing a site which is recognized by RNA
                polymerase and a binding site for pdh repressive protein combined with arcA gene and the ompW promoter
                containing a binding site for RNA polymerase and ArcA repressive protein combined with pdhR gene.
            </div>

            <div class="container-paragraph">
                The inducer to pdhR is the pyruvate and the inducer to arcA is the aerobic condition, in which arcB
                loses its kinase activity allowing the dephosphorylation of ArcA inactivating this protein and leading
                the gene expression.
            </div>

            <div class="container-paragraph">
                Furthermore curiously, in many bacteria the ArcA protein is activated not only in anaerobic conditions
                then is activated by the addition of H2O2 to the environment showing a response to oxidative stress, but
                this phenomenon have not been demonstrated in E. coli.
